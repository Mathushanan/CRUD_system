# 🚦 Digital Traffic Fine Management System – Sri Lankan Motor Traffic 🇱🇰

## Overview

The **Digital Traffic Fine Management System** is a comprehensive web-based application designed to transform Sri Lanka’s outdated,
 manual traffic fine management process into an efficient, scalable, and secure digital solution. The platform empowers all stakeholders—System Admins, Station Admins, 
Traffic Police Officers, and Public Users—with tailored functionality to streamline fine issuance, processing, payment, and analytics.

## 📌 Motivation

With Sri Lanka experiencing a surge in vehicle registrations (from 4.87 million in 2012 to 8.36 million in 2023) and over 38,000 road accidents annually, 
the manual traffic fine system has become increasingly inefficient. 
This project was developed to:

- Reduce human errors and processing delays
- Improve road safety and enforcement transparency
- Enable secure online fine payments and tracking
- Support data-driven decision-making and reporting

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Develop a user-friendly, responsive web platform
- Enable digital fine issuance and real-time violation tracking
- Automate fine processing and notification dispatch
- Integrate secure online payments using Stripe
- Allow real-time fine status tracking for users
- Implement robust role-based access control (RBAC)
- Support data analytics and PDF reporting
- Ensure multi-device and multi-browser compatibility
- Leverage cloud infrastructure for scalability
- Maintain comprehensive logs and audit trails
